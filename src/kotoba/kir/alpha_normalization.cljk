(ns kotoba.kir.alpha-normalization
  "Alpha-normalization of a KIR function: binders renamed by position, so that
  two spellings of the same definition are the same definition.

  ## Why this lives here and not in the callers

  `kotoba.kir.definition-identity/normalize` is a canonical ENCODER over a
  closed tagged value domain. It is not binder-aware: it maps a symbol to
  `[\"sym\" <name>]` verbatim. Measured 2026-09-02, two payloads differing only
  in a binder name hash to different CIDs -- `(+ a 1)` to
  bafyreigucwk5cmuh7b7xwcviysfzuiemmevwqvj6jl3i3wuwvnzdmdmmki and `(+ b 1)` to
  bafyreiazdjhcwy3jj3sigeol5ydpaopblxx3bksbrknxzaoauwxasie6ka. So a caller that
  wants `:alpha-rename-independent` (kotoba-lang `lang/elaboration-pipeline.edn`,
  stage `:definition-cid`) has to rename first.

  Both callers did, separately: `kotoba.codebase.typed-code` and
  `kotoba.compiler.definition-identity` each carried the same five-binder walk
  over the same KIR. kotoba-lang `lang/code-identity.edn` recorded that as a
  residual risk of :ci8 and named the fix -- move the walk INTO kotoba-kir,
  not into a third place. This namespace is that move.

  ## The five binding forms, and what happens to a sixth

  KIR binds a name in exactly five places: a function's `params`, `let`,
  `result-match-of`, `variant-match` and `option-match`. `binding-forms` names
  the four that appear as operators.

  A sixth binding form added to KIR later would not be renamed here.
  `verify-normalized!` refuses a normalized function whose body still contains
  a name this walk DID rename, which is the shape such a form produces when it
  takes a name already bound and lets a reference to it escape. Use
  `normalize-function` unless you have a reason to run the two halves apart --
  it is the pair, and it cannot be forgotten.

  MEASURED LIMIT (2026-09-02). Both copies this namespace replaces documented
  that check as catching any sixth binding form. It does not, and the claim is
  corrected here rather than carried. A form whose binder is a name the walk
  never bound -- `(loop [i 0] (+ i 1))` with no outer `i` -- leaks nothing by
  that test, so `i` is sealed into the identity and two spellings of that
  function get two CIDs. Telling `i` apart from a legitimate free reference to
  a callee needs a table of KIR operators, which kotoba-kir does not own and
  which inventing here would make a second admission gate. So the guard against
  a sixth binding form is `binding-forms` being public, `handles?` answering
  it, and `kotoba.kir-alpha-normalization-test/the-refusal-does-not-catch-a-
  self-contained-unhandled-form` naming the hole -- not a check that closes it.
  A KIR change that adds a binding head must add it to `binding-forms`.

  ## Reconciling the two copies it replaces (measured 2026-09-02)

  The two walks were the same algorithm and differed in two places:

  - `set?`: the compiler's copy renamed inside a set; the codebase's copy had
    no `set?` branch, so a set fell to the leaf and any bound symbol inside it
    survived -- which `verify-normalized!` then refused. The branch is kept.
    It widens a refusal into a CID; it moves no CID that exists, because the
    case it changes is exactly the case that produced no CID before.
  - the leaf: the compiler's copy mapped a host number to the identity's
    admitted `i64`/`f64` form (nbb holds a `.kotoba` integer literal as a
    JavaScript BigInt, which is neither `integer?` nor `number?` in
    ClojureScript); the codebase's copy left the leaf alone, because its own
    encoder admits host floats directly. Neither belongs to alpha-renaming, so
    it is a caller-supplied `:scalar` function, defaulting to `identity`. Each
    caller keeps the leaf it had, byte for byte.

  Nothing else differed, including the counter discipline: ONE left-to-right
  counter over the whole function that never resets, so a canonical name is a
  function of position alone. A counter that restarted per binding form would
  give `k0` to two different binders and make two different functions share an
  identity.

  ## This is not called by `definition-cid`, deliberately

  `kotoba.kir.definition-identity/definition-cid` does NOT normalize
  internally. That is a decision, not an omission:

  1. It hashes a PAYLOAD, whose `:definition/kir` is any KIR value -- a
     `{:op :const}`, a `{:op :do}`, a function. Normalizing internally would
     mean guessing which shape has binders. Seven of the ten frozen vectors in
     kotoba-lang `lang/code-identity-vectors.edn` carry `{:op :const :value 1}`.
  2. Renaming has to happen BEFORE dependency linking, not at hash time. A
     caller replaces callee symbols with `[:kotoba.definition/ref <cid>]` nodes
     after normalizing; a normalizer running at hash time would run after that
     substitution, on a body whose call targets are no longer symbols.
  3. Verification needs the caller's set of call targets to tell a leaked
     binder from a legitimate free name. `definition-cid` does not have it and
     should not: an identity function that asks for a name table is not an
     identity function.
  4. The ten frozen vectors must not move, and an internal step is a step that
     could move them. Measured after this change: all ten are byte-identical.

  The safety this gives up -- that identity cannot be computed over
  un-normalized KIR -- is bought back by `verify-normalized!` refusing at the
  caller, which is also the only place that can check it.")
